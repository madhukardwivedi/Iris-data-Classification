This is basic usecase of Multiclass classification. In this project, I have used dataset available 
at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv. 

I have performed basic EDA and visualization of data features. Here, i have used six different
algorithms:

# 1. Logistic regression
# 2. Linear Discrriminant Analysis (LDA)
# 3. k-nearset neighbour (KNN)
# 4. Classification and Regression Trees(CART)
# 5. Guassian Naive Bayes(NB)
# 6. Support Vector Machine(SVM)

The best accuracy was given by Support Vector Machine (SVM) i.e. 96%.
